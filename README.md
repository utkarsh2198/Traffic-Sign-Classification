# Traffic-Sign-Classification
## Introduction
The problem we are gonna tackle is The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark(GTSRB). The problem is to to recognize the traffic sign from the images. Solving this problem is essential for self-driving cars to operate on roads.

The dataset features 43 different signs under various sizes, lighting conditions, occlusions and is very similar to real-life data. Training set includes about 39000 images while test set has around 12000 images. Images are not guaranteed to be of fixed dimensions and the sign is not necessarily centered in each image. Each image contains about 10% border around the actual traffic sign.
Our approach to solving the problem will of course be very successful convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are multi-layered feed-forward neural networks that are able to learn task-specific invariant features in a hierarchical manner.
